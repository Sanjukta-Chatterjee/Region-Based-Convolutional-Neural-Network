# Region-Based-Convolutional-Neural-Network

Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) is a type of deep learning architecture used for object detection in computer vision tasks. RCNN was one of the pioneering models that helped advance the object detection field by combining the power of convolutional neural networks and region-based approaches.It is a significant improvement over previous object detection methods, as it combines the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with region proposals to achieve high-accuracy object detection.
